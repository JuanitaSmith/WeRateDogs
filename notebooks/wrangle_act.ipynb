    "This project was completed as part of the 'Data Analyst' nanodegree with Udacity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the project was to demonstrate the data wrangling and analysis skills obtained from the course.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset to be wrangled is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. Dog owners upload a picture of their dog, writes a funny comment and give their own dog a rating out of 10. Owners almost always give their dogs a rating greater than 10. e.g 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, it's the nature of the website. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. It's only a bit of fun, and brings great joy when browsing the cutest dog images !"

    "### Data\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, 3 datasets needs to be gathered automatically, assessed and cleaned\n",
    "\n",
    "4 data gathering strategies was demonstrated:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Twitter archive - Automated downloaded from an URL\n",
    "\n",
    "WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for a sample of 2356 tweets with ratings, for a period between Nov 2015 - July 2017.\n",
    "Data was automatically downloaded from the Udacity website using `pd.read_csv` and passing the URL 'https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/59a4e958_twitter-archive-enhanced/twitter-archive-enhanced.csv' as input.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Use twitter API 'tweepy v2' to retrieve additional data\n",
    "\n",
    "For each tweet in the twitter archive from step 1, the retweet and like count was retrieved as minimum requirement for the project\n",
    "\n",
    "The latest version of the tweepy API was used to retrieve additional data, which offered more flexibility and data availability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each tweet's entire JSON response was dumped to a txt file, each tweet on its own line\n",
    "\n",
    "The .txt file was read line by line, and the most useful data to be reused was added to a pandas dataframe. \n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Use the Requests library to download the tweet breed predictions (image_predictions.tsv)\n",
    "\n",
    "Udacity provided a file that used the dog images to predict the breed of the dog.\n",
    "Each tweet consist of the link to the image that gave the best predictions, 3 predictions, each with it's confidence level and if the prediction is actually a valid dog breed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This file (image_predictions.tsv), is hosted on Udacity's servers and was downloaded programmatically using the Requests library and the following URL: https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/August/599fd2ad_image-predictions/image-predictions.tsv\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Download dog profile images (optional extra step)\n",
    "\n",
    "Image urls containing `.jpg` retrieved from API in step 2 was used to download the first dog image for each tweet from the internet, as additional practice. I had in mind for visualization to show a dog profile card of the most liked breeds and dogs."
