    "The dataset to be wrangled and analysed, is the tweet archive of Twitter user [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates), also known as [WeRateDogs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WeRateDogs). WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog. Dog owners upload a picture of their dog, writes a funny comment and give their own dog a rating out of 10. Owners almost always give their dogs a rating greater than 10. e.g 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, it's the nature of the website. WeRateDogs has over 4 million followers and has received international media coverage. It's only a bit of fun, and brings great joy when browsing the cutest dog images !"
